        Being that I am the Advertisement/Marketing Executive for the Georgia
        Tech Salsa club, it's my responsibility to manage the social media
        profiles of the Salsa Club and to generate artwork in order to make our
        presence on campus made known loudly.
      </p>

        The exterior side is above. The interior is below. I wanted a design
        that would stand out amongst the inevitable hundreds of brochures that
        incoming students at Georgia Tech would receive. Something you can spot
        from a hundred feet away and something that is unequivocally modern and
        flashy.
      </p>
      <p>
        My philosophy was to remove unnecessary detail and simply everything
        down to one font and two to three powerful colors in order to make the
        information more digestible. I learned that you can make a design both
        loud and sophisticated if you have the right constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regards to the deep red (not a usual Georgia Tech color), I
        collaborated with president Nicole Diaz and we had a really great
        conversation about color theory and what associations certain colors
        have with certain ideas. Salsa is associated with the color red so I
        made the executive call, even though she expressed a really great
        argument for gold. The compromise I made was that the following few
        posts would use official Georgia Tech colors. It is really fascinated
        how passionate people get regarding color. Something to keep in mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following are some of the templates I designed to introduce our new
        executive board. I as well went for something clean and loud, like the
        previous artwork. I really learned how animations really play into the
        perceived quality of a social media post. My teammates expressed
        specifically that the animation made such a significant difference in
        how attractive the post was, in their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned how little one actually needs to communicate visually when
        producing posts designed for the busy digital world of Instagram. When
        it comes to introducing our members, I could have included each of our
        favorite spot on campus, favorite quote, major, and etc. but I chose to
        eliminate all of this information and simply stick to a unified theme
        that emphasizes seeking the attention of a user instead of trying to
        communicate as much as possible. The information is actually saved to
        the Highlights feature of Instagram, which, according to market data, is
        where users tend to spend more time reading and paying attention to
        written content. That is why I placed the written portion of the bios in the Highlights section.
