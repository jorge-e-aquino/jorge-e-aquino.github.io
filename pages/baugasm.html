        My first foray into working with the Creative Cloud culminated around
        the futuristic and gaudy style of Baugasm, an art style named with a
        portmanteau: combining "Bauhaus" and, well, take a guess.

        These pieces were initialized in Illustrator and then I exported them
        into Photoshop for most of the work. I think some of them are truly
        beautiful if I had to give myself some praise. The typography was
        implemented both as a sort of stylish watermark but also to practice
        complimenting abstract color landscapes with the industriousness of
        typography.

        Thank you for taking the time to look at some of my first digital art.

        The following piece is an alteration of Untitled 001, one that I employ
        as my profile picture on my Instagram page @jog.ea, where I have posted
        some artwork.

        This next one is one of my favorites. I was really excited to watch The
        Lighthouse and I decided to make a little poster just for the fun of it.
        The photoshop job around Pattinson could use some work but overall I
        think I did a good job styling it in the aesthetic of the 2019 film.
