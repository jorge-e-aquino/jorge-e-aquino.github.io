		<p> My first foray into working with the Creative Cloud culminated around the futuristic and gaudy style of Baugasm, an art style named after the art movement "Bauhaus." </p>
		<p> These pieces were initialized in Illustrator and then I exported them into Photoshop for most of the work. I think some of them are truly beautiful if I had to give myself some praise. The typography was implemented both as a sort of stylish watermark but also to practice complimenting abstract color landscapes with the industriousness of typography. </p> <img src="https://pro2-bar-s3-cdn-cf.myportfolio.com/e9dc4e29-2308-4623-83aa-ed8c86651717/15e172d6-29f7-49c7-855f-5b4be59cd52e.png?h=00ebd0a5b4a7cb09f24560c35189db1e" loading="lazy" /> <img src="https://pro2-bar-s3-cdn-cf1.myportfolio.com/e9dc4e29-2308-4623-83aa-ed8c86651717/99044e96-20aa-4d7e-b1d8-4f1e35a2a798_rw_3840.png?h=e7b335a97620c2ee40d4c8f951bf077c" loading="lazy" /> <img src="https://pro2-bar-s3-cdn-cf4.myportfolio.com/e9dc4e29-2308-4623-83aa-ed8c86651717/5817832e-facb-4bfa-9df2-10697bee97a5_rw_3840.png?h=60e7868365f558ec01996a695be64ce6" loading="lazy" /> <img src="https://pro2-bar-s3-cdn-cf6.myportfolio.com/e9dc4e29-2308-4623-83aa-ed8c86651717/a8728de6-d77d-46d7-a823-73c5a8ab4415_rw_3840.png?h=a4316ac21d06f786204f0e00cdd29778" loading="lazy" /> <img src="https://pro2-bar-s3-cdn-cf1.myportfolio.com/e9dc4e29-2308-4623-83aa-ed8c86651717/273d1a58-457e-4935-9476-8f0d310c4e88_rw_3840.png?h=12ef8a12626251d8758975f5f3b07168" loading="lazy" /> <img src="https://pro2-bar-s3-cdn-cf1.myportfolio.com/e9dc4e29-2308-4623-83aa-ed8c86651717/248aaee5-9272-47b0-b0f4-949e92e62c02_rw_3840.png?h=83211bcf76e1daf54529401cc2919330" loading="lazy" />
		<p> This next one is one of my favorites. I was really excited to watch The Lighthouse and I decided to make a little poster just for the fun of it. I studied up on typography and wanted to make a poster reminiscent of posters from 60's psych rock bands but constrained to a simple structure. I realized how beautiful human faces look when paired with a complimentary color palette, and being that the film is shot in grayscale, the gradient and vanishing typography really work well together. I really got into the flow of creating posters that I find visually attractive even if they are abstract.
			<br />
			<br /> I always base my designs off of real things, like orchid petals, trees against a blue sky, the human body, or celestial bodies. Studying the art of Baugasm helped me learn how to marry maximalism with minimalism in a way that invites conversation, and hopefully engages viewers to want to find out more. </p> <img src="https://pro2-bar-s3-cdn-cf1.myportfolio.com/e9dc4e29-2308-4623-83aa-ed8c86651717/c2654125-532d-4062-a9d8-1612b37a92c2_rw_3840.png?h=2a6ce8402da2de28a5674befd6fd9d8e" loading="lazy" /> </div>
