Welcome to the jorge-e-aquino.github.io wiki!
This is my personal portfolio site that I am building from scratch.
For LMC 2700 (Intro to Computational Media).

(Software to use: html, css)

Create a web site consisting of at least 4 pages. The site should represent aspects of you that you wish to present to potential employers or colleagues and friends. The site should have the basic elements: in addition to text and graphics, a menu and a navigation structure. The web site should reflect your “brand.” In designing and populating the site, you should ask yourself what impression you want to make with the site and for whom.

There are many different design strategies that you can employ for your site. Here is a link to set of 50 different portfolio examples to give you ideas: https://collegeinfogeek.com/personal-website-examples/. (Links to an external site.)

You will submit a draft of the site for preliminary grading on September 11, but you should continue to refine and add to the site throughout the semester, because you will be asked submit the improved version by Dec 5. The final version will replace the preliminary grade.
